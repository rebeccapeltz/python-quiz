are there any instructions for adding a new domain name to a repository when you have an existing domain name for your .github.io?

Message 8 of 8 from Copilot received at 5:48:18 PM Yes, you can add a new custom domain to your repository even if you have an existing domain for your `<username>.github.io`. Here's how you can do it: 1. First, you need to configure your new domain with your DNS provider. For an apex domain, you'll need to set up `A` or `ALIAS`/`ANAME` records. For a `www` subdomain, you'll need a `CNAME` record. The exact steps will depend on your DNS provider. 2. Once your DNS is configured, go to your GitHub repository that you want to link with the new domain. 3. Under your repository name, click **Settings**. 4. In the "GitHub Pages" section, under "Custom domain", enter your new custom domain. 5. Click **Save**. 6. In your repository, navigate to the newly created `CNAME` file and ensure the new custom domain is listed there. Remember, changes to your DNS records can take up to 24 hours to propagate, so the new domain might not work immediately. If you want to enforce HTTPS for your new domain, you can do so in the repository settings under the "GitHub Pages" section. However, it can take up to 24 hours before the "Enforce HTTPS" option is available. For more detailed instructions, you can refer to the GitHub Docs on [Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).
